Hi. It's rwanda. After months of failure I am back to complete this project and hopefully continue my education at Flatiron.

This app is will have a list of The Office characters, with each season having a different version of the character, and users will be able to save the characters they like to their profile. This is my topic for the app because I really like The Office and feel passionate about the varying quality of seasons.

current commits: 


#gem install activerecord #gem install rake #gem install sinatra #gem install shotgun #done


TODO!!!
Must have user accounts - users must be able to sign up, sign in, and sign out. - add password
Validate uniqueness of user login attribute (username or email).
Validate user input so bad data cannot be persisted to the database.
